This is a fork of Assimp.Net.  The original repository is available at:
https://github.com/assimp/assimp-net

Major differences are as followed:
* Converted the projects/solutions to .Net Core projects/solutions.
* AssimpNet now targets .Net Standard 2.0.
* Removed AssimpNet.Interop.Generator in favor of using the System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe Nuget package.
